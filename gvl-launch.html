    	<h2>What is a private GVL Server?</h2>
		<p>A private GVL server is a virtual machine running on the cloud and
            contains a pre-installed suite of tools for performing
		bioinformatics analyses. It differs from public GVL servers by
        providing full administrative access to the server,
		as well as the full suite of GVL services, whereas public GVL servers
        provide restricted access for security reasons.
		For example, public GVL servers do not provide access to the Ubuntu desktop,
        the Linux commandline, ipython, rstudio etc. at present.
		</p>
		<p>
		Private GVL servers may be launched on a public cloud of your choice
        (at present, Amazon and Openstack based clouds). These
		can be as simple as servers which provide individual access,
        to more complicated institutional access servers over which you
		will have full control. You will require access credentials to a
        public/community cloud to launch a private GVL server.
		Accessing the GVL server is completely free on the Australian
        NeCTAR Research Cloud, provided that you have a suitable account
		with NeCTAR. On Amazon, while the GVL software itself is free,
        you may have to pay Amazon usage charges.
		</p>
		<p>
		For more information about these options, refer to the guide
        <a href="">here</a>.

    	<h5>What is a flavour?</h5>
	    	<p>
	    	Flavours are versions of the GVL with slightly customised toolsets. These toolsets are optimised for
	    	different usage patterns. For example, the Tutorial flavour is intended for running the GVL tutorials,
	    	and the Microbial flavour is optimised for Microbial workflows.
