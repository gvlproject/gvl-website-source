	    	<h5>What is a flavour?</h5>
	    	<p>
	    	Flavours are versions of the GVL with slightly customised toolsets. These toolsets are optimised for
	    	different usage patterns. For example, the Tutorial flavour is intended for running the GVL tutorials,
	    	and the Microbial flavour is optimised for Microbial workflows.
